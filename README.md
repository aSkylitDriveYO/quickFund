Prototype website for Quickfund which is a fundraising company that a friend of mine owns. I am using React and Styled Components as well as React router for routing the single page application. I am still talking it over with my friend and trying to define the scope of this project since I know very little about the fundraising business and what his needs will be to maximize efficiency and in turn create more successful fundraising campaigns. One of the things being figured out is if Next.js will be more beneficial for SOE and also what kind of technology to use for his database on different schools ( MongoDB vs Postgres )
